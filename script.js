/* JavaScript Types */

// Foundation Challenges:
// Task: Create a variable called `fullName` and set it to your full name as one string.
// Tip: Concatenate your first and last name together using the `+` operator.
let fullName = ""; // Your solution here




// Task: Create a variable called `largestNumber` and set it to the larger of two given numbers.
// Tip: Use an `if` statement to check which number is larger and assign it to `largestNumber`.
let largestNumber; // Your solution here




// Task: Add the two given numbers together using the `+` operator.
// Tip: Use the `+` operator to add the two numbers together.
let sum; // Your solution here




// Intermediate Challenges:

// Task: Count how many letters are in a given password and store it in a variable called `passwordLength`.
// Tip: Access the `length` property of the password string to find its length.
let passwordLength; // Your solution here




// Task: Use the `typeof` operator to determine the type of the given variable.
// Tip: Use the `typeof` operator followed by the variable name to determine its type.
let type; // Your solution here




// Task: Determine if a given name follows name tag rules (less than or equal to 8 characters and starts with a capital letter), and store the result in a variable called `isValidNameTag`.
// Tip: Use an `if` statement to check if the name length is less than or equal to 8 characters and the first letter is uppercase.
let isValidNameTag; // Your solution here





/* JavaScript Functions */

// Foundation Challenges:

// Task: Create a recipe string by joining a given array of ingredients with a "+" sign.
// Tip: Use the `join()` method with "+" as the separator to concatenate the array elements.
let recipeString; // Your solution here




// Task: Use array indexing to select the first and last items and create a new array.
// Tip: Use array indexing to select the first and last items from the array and create a new array with them.
let firstAndLastItems; // Your solution here




// Task: Use a loop to iterate through the array and add each number to a running total.
// Tip: Use a loop to iterate through the array, adding each number to a running total.
let totalScores; // Your solution here




// Intermediate Challenges:

// Task: Use a loop to iterate from 0 to the given number, adding each number to a running total.
// Tip: Use a loop to iterate from 0 to the given number, adding each number to a running total.
let totalRange; // Your solution here




// Task: Use array methods like `pop()` and `unshift()` to manipulate the array.
// Tip: Use array methods like `pop()` and `unshift()` to remove the last item and add it to the beginning of the array.
let movedFirstAndLastItems; // Your solution here




// Task: Use a loop to iterate through the array, adding odd numbers to a new array.
// Tip: Use a loop to iterate through the array, adding odd numbers to a new array.
let oddNumbers; // Your solution here



/* JavaScript Arrays */

// Foundation Challenges:

// Task: Simply create an array with the given ingredients.
// Tip: Create an array with the given ingredients.
let recipeIngredients = ["Bacon", "Lettuce", "Tomato"];




// Task: Use array indexing to select the first and last items and create a new array.
// Tip: Use array indexing to select the first and last items from the array and create a new array with them.
let firstAndLastItemsArray = [recipeIngredients[0], recipeIngredients[recipeIngredients.length - 1]];




// Task: Use a loop to iterate through the array, adding each number to a running total.
// Tip: Use a loop to iterate through the array, adding each number to a running total.
let totalScoresArray; // Will be linked to the previous array task




// Intermediate Challenges:

// Task: Use a loop to iterate from 0 to 10, adding each number to a new array.
// Tip: Use a loop to iterate from 0 to 10, adding each number to a new array.
let totalRangeArray; // Your solution here




// Task: Use array methods like `pop()` and `unshift()` to manipulate the array.
// Tip: Use array methods like `pop()` and `unshift()` to remove the last item and add it to the beginning of the array.
let movedLastItemToBeginning; // Will be linked to the previous array task




// Task: Use a loop to iterate through the array, adding odd numbers to a new array.
// Tip: Use a loop to iterate through the array, adding odd numbers to a new array.
let oddNumbersArray; // Will be linked to the previous array task
